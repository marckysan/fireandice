# fireandice
React Native Project for Fire and Ice App

##Tech Stack Requirements:
- React Navigation;
- Architecture based on redux;
- Thunk for async actions;
- Jest for eventual tests;

##Question Requirements:
Using https://anapioficeandfire.com/ API, please prepare a React-Native application that will run on Android and iOS devices. 
The application should be able to display a list of Game of Thrones characters in the list, which will contain the characters' name and the picture (thumbnail) taken from https://picsum.photos/ page. 
This page contains an endpoint which allows user to get the picture by id, for example https://i.picsum.photos/id/100/200/300.jpg (please see the website for details). 
For the sake of this task, please take a picture with id equal to the current index of the characters list. 
Every item displayed on the list should be clickable and the tap action should navigate to another screen with details of the chosen character. 
The screen should contain the bigger image, name of the character and some other data chosen by you (at least one field more).
You can use the design which will fit your style, you can also use material design guidelines.
